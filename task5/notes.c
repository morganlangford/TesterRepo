/*  The four levels of error:
	- error vs warning: if an error happens, it won't compile your code; 
	doesn't produce a .o file. With a warning it still does - but 
	it's probably wrong. Will compile .o file, not .exe though
	These are compiler errors. Often things like misspelling/syntax 
	(missing ;, assigning things of the wrong type) 
	They're tedious, usually easy to find, easy to fix
