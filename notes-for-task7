Programming of microcontrollers - similar to PIC, arduino

Normally we have von neumann architechture for a computer 
	ALU, CU, REGISTERS & a lot of MEMORY
The memory is usually DRAM - dynamic random access memory, just uses capacitors
	'Dynamic' because the capacitor slowly, continuously discharges from 1 to 0 so it needs to be topped up
	When computer turns off, everything discharges

Microcontrollers use a different architechture - Harvard
Mem is divided into two sections - program & data memory - completely separate
	Prog mem is flash memory - non-volatile, like a flash drive
	Data mem is SRAM, faster but takes up more mem

The chip we'll use is the ATMEGA 328P
