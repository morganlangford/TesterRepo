/* 
Serial communication - efficient in terms of resources
Just need one wire and a clock
Way better than doing everything in parallel where 
you need a ton of wires

UART - stands for universal something
Has another name RS-232
Connects from TX to RX 
Has a few draw backs - only two devices connected together usually
More is difficult and confusing 
Other problem is the data is square wave pulses
The machines have to know what rate the data will be 
coming in at because there's no syncronization between them
Band rate must be agreed ahead of time by user
They also must have an interrupt so it'll stop what it's doing 
and listen to the data suddenly coming in 

Want syncronous periferal interface
Divide everything into masters and slaves 
Master: MOSI, MISO, SCK
MOSI stands for master out slave in 
MISO stands for master in slave out 
Now we can connect to multiple devices 
All MOSI's are connected together, all MISO's connected together 
Master sends out continuous square wave, all connected
work at that speed - connected via clock
Also a CS1, CS2, ... "chip select" - chooses which device to talk to
